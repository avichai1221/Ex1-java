the classs monom and polynom:

This class can help you to work with monom's and polynom's .
The monom: a*x^b
You can built them in three different ways.
1) With "a" and "b" (note : "b" can't be a negative number )
2) With anther monom.
3) With a string that represent the monom (note : its can only be from the
shape of : ax^b).
There is several functions you can work with the monom :
1) You can add another monom.
2) You can subtract another monom.
3) You can get the power.
4) You can get the coefficient.
5) You can get the value of this monom in some "x" point.
6) You can get the derivative monom of this monom.
7) You can ask if this is the "zero monom" =0*x^b
8) You can multiply with another monom.
9) You can check if this monom is equals to another monom.
10) You can convert this monom to string from the shape "a*x^b"
The polynom: monom + monom + monom
Note it's have all the restrictions like the monom.
You can built them in two different ways
1) With zero monom's = "zero polynom"
2) With a string that represent the polynom (note : its can only be from the shape of : ax^b+ ax^bâ€¦).
There is several functions you can work with the polynom :
1) You can add another monom.
2) You can add another polynom.
3) You can subtract another monom.
4) You can subtract another polynom.
5) You can get the value of this polynom in some "x" point
6) You can derivative the monom.
7) You can ask if this is the "zero polynom"
8) You can multiply with another monom.
9) You can multiply with another polynom.
10) You can check if this monom is equals to another polynom.
11) You can convert this monom to string from the shape "a*x^b"
12) You create deep copy of this polynom
13) You can get the root of this polynom between two points
14) You can get the area of this polynom between two points (above axis x)

the class ComplexFunction:

This class can help you to work with ComplexFunction.

You can built them in three different ways.

with 2 functions and operation or with 2 functions and string for the operation.

with 1 functions (left).

There is several functions you can work with ComplexFunction :

1)You can add anuter function.
2)You can multiply another function.
3)You can divides another function.
4)You can get the maximum between complex functions and function.
5)You can get the minimom between complex functions and function.
6)you can get complex functions(f1(x))-->comp
7)You can returns the left side of the complex function.
8)You can returns the right side of the complex function.
9)you can get the op.

This class Functions_GUI:

This class can help you to work with GUI.

this class extend from collection so it can did all the functions that collection can. (it is implements).

this class can get new collection of functions from a file.

this class can draws all the functions in the collection in a GUI window using the
given parameters for the GUI windows and the range & resolution.
  
this class can draws all the functions in the collection in a GUI window using the given JSON file.
  
this class can a new collection of functions from a file.
